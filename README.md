PiMPa represents the pinnacle of my professional journey, a creative oasis where my projects come to life and where I’ve had the privilege to organize, design, and execute ideas alongside those who’ve trusted in my skills. Yet, above all, PiMPa holds a special place in my heart because it’s also the name of my cat.
